Songs just speed up instead of offering any unique difficulty to tile layouts. The game doesn't give you a sense of accomplishment because there is no completing a certain difficulty, it can always go faster and you will eventually miss a single note. If you are looking to install this game to introduce yourself to rhythm gaming, please skip it. There is a lot more to offer in the genre than this piano tile experience.</td>
